# Live Project

### For two weeks towards the end of my Tech Academy Bootcamp, I worked in a Team Sprint developing a project using ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework and utilizing the Aglie/Scrum Methodology. The project I worked on is an interactive website for managing the content and productions for a theater/acting company. I was expected to complete at least 2 User Stories and attend 10 daily Stand-Up meetings, as well as participate in Code Retrospectives at the end. This provided some real-world experience and practice using clean version control and Azure DevOps.

### Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and screen shots.
